//- moves by “hopLength” units in current direction
//- if at edge of board and can’t move/hop in current
//direction (as it is against an edge), then set a new
//direction at random. (repeat until bug can move
//forward) and then move.
//- if bug can’t move/hop the full ‘hopLength’, then the
//bug does move but ‘hits’ the edge and falls on the
//square where it hit the edge/wall
//- record new position in hoppers path history
